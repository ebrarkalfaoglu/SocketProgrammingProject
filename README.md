# SocketProgrammingProject

This project is a modular Python-based application developed to explore fundamental **network programming concepts** such as sockets, SNTP time synchronization, client-server communication, and error management.

---

## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview

The system consists of several independent yet connected modules that demonstrate various aspects of **socket programming and data integration**.

### Modules:

| Module | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| **Machine Information** | Displays system name, IP address, and network interfaces. |
| **Echo Server** | Tests client-server communication by echoing back sent messages. |
| **SNTP Time Synchronization** | Retrieves accurate time from an SNTP server and compares it with local system time. |
| **Chat Module** | Enables basic real-time text messaging between server and client. |
| **Socket Settings & Error Management** | Demonstrates timeout handling, buffer size settings, blocking/non-blocking modes, and exception management. |
| **Data Integration** | Integrates SNTP time and Echo Test results with other modules (e.g., logging and error tracking). |
